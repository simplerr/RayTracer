# RayTracer

![Image](ray_tracer_main.png)

This was my project in the "TSBK07 Computer Graphics" course at Link√∂pings University. It is a GPU accelerated raytracer with reflections,
refractions and shadows implemented in a compute shader. It runs in real-time and you can move the spheres and lights in the scene around.
